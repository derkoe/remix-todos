# Todo App in Remix

This is a demo application showing the use of [Remix](https://remix.run/).

There are also [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) versions for comparison:

- [Quarkus with htmx](https://github.com/derkoe/quarkus-htmx-todos)
- [Quarkus with Hotwire](https://github.com/derkoe/quarkus-hotwire-todos)

## Development

After checkout run `npm install`.

For developing the app:

```sh
docker-compse up -d
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
